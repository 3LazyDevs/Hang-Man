**Introduction**
Hangman is a quick and easy game for at least two people that requires nothing more than paper, a pencil, and the ability to spell. One player, the "host," makes up a secret word, while the other player tries to guess the word by asking what letters it contains. However, every wrong guess brings them one step closer to losing. Hangman can also be customized to make the game easier, harder, or educational, and there are apps and websites to play online if you would like. Hangman can be adapted by people of all agesand can be used in a variety of settings. Hangman is not only far more interactive than some spelling rote learning method, but also it is far more enjoyable.

The steps to play a basic game of hangman are -
1. Choose one person to be the "host." This is the person that invents the puzzle for the other person to solve. They will be tasked with choosing a word or phrase        that "the players" will have to solve.
2. If you are the host, choose a secret word. The other players will need to guess your word letter by letter, so choose a word you think will be difficult to guess.      Difficult words usually have uncommon letters, like "z," or "j," and only a few vowels.
3. Draw a blank line for each letter in the word. For example, if the executioner chooses the word "zipper," she/he would draw six blanks, one for each letter
   ( _ _ _ _ _ _ ). The host does not tell anyone else the secret word.
4. Start guessing letters if you are the player. Once the word has been chosen and the players know how many letters in the secret word, begin guessing which letters        are in the word by asking the host. For example, you might begin by asking, "is there an 'e' in your word?"
5. Fill the letter in the blanks if the players guess correctly. Whenever the players guess a letter that is in the secret word, the host fills it into the blank where      it occurs. For example, if the word is "zipper" and the players guess "e," then the host will fill in the 5th blank with an "e:" (_ _ _ _ e _).
6. Draw part of the "hangman" when the players guess wrong. Whenever the players guess a letter that is not in the secret word they get a strike that brings them closer    to losing. To show this, the host draws a simple stick figure of a man being hung, adding a new part to the drawing with every wrong answer. This is also where you      can adjust the difficulty of the game -- the more marks you make, the more wrong guesses the player gets and the easier the game is. The classic order is:
      ● First wrong answer: Draw a small circle for the "head" underneath the horizontal line of the "L."
      ● Second: Draw a line down from the bottom of the head for the "neck."
      ● Third: Draw two arms out from the middle of his body for the "arms."
      ● Fourth: Draw a line down from the bottom of the neck for the "upper body."
      ● Fifth: Draw another line down from the bottom of the upper body for the "lower body."
      ● Sixth: Draw two diagonal lines from the bottom of the body for the two "legs." Once you draw the entire body, the players have lost the game.
7. The players win when they guess the correct word. If the players get every letter of the word before the host finishes drawing then they win.
8. Play online or on an app to practice by yourself. Thanks to its simplicity, online hangman games are everywhere, and easy to find with a quick internet search for        "online hangman." Many games use online dictionaries to choose words, allowing you to practice building your vocabulary while you play. You can even play games           against opponents from all over the world with some apps
